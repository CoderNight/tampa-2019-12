Long time, no see! We're resuming CoderNight with another Holiday Event and some challenges.

• Before the event We're returning to the original format a bit. We've got two
  challenges at two levels. Feel free to do one or both, but do one of them.
  Email your solutions as a link to a github repo to me, Harvey, at
  hchapman-meetup_AT_3gfp.com. You can email me the source if needed.

• What to bring We're doing another white elephant gift exchange. Bring a $10-20
  white elephant gift and holiday treats. • Important to know There will be some
  sort of meetup-style food provided.
